# github@cisa.dhs.gov is a very generic email distribution, and it is
# unlikely that anyone on that distribution is familiar with the
# particulars of your repository.  It is therefore *strongly*
# suggested that you use an email address here that is specific to the
# person or group that maintains this repository; for example:
# LABEL org.opencontainers.image.authors="vm-fusion-dev-group@trio.dhs.gov"
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.authors="github@cisa.dhs.gov"
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.vendor="Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency"
